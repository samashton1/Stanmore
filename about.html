Stanmore Estate & Gardens is a place of enormous character, charm and interest. Visitors are frequently struck by the warm and intimate atmosphere and the feeling that Stanmore is a much-cherished family home.
The Gardens, which are amongst the finest in Britain, are outstanding for their vitality, variety and historical interest and are particularly celebrated for the magnificent hedges.
Stanmore's much loved fallow deer have been part of our estate since the park walls were built in 1848, and they roam freely around the parkland. If you take a walk around the wider park, you’ll almost certainly see them munching on grass or reaching up to eat the low hanging leaves.
We’re lucky to have all four colours of fallow deer – common (tan with white spots, fading to a grey colour in winter), menil (tan but with white spots year round), melanistic (almost entirely black or chocolate coloured) and white (a pale sandy colour, turning white with age).
